# HowtoReadMe
The first step is to **create the repository, with a readme.md**. There are a large number of tutorials on GitHub, Git and repository creation. 

Here are some links:

Once you have created your repository, **with a readme.md** there are a number of ways to update the file.  One is to simply edit it by clicking on the pencil looking icon.

Now that the File is open you can Edit the file using Markdown. 
GitHub has a great tutorial on markdown here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Once you have your readme created and updated the way you want, some tips to remember are: 
1. Don't forget to git pull your remote changes to your local repository. 
2. Don't forget to git add / commit / push any additional screen shots or pics that you place in your local. 
3. Keep your readme up-to-date with the latest information about any *ACTIVE* repositories.  
4. If you don't want to maintain the readme and the repository any longer, consider archiving it, or notating in the readme, that the repository is no longer active. 

**BOOTCAMP STUDENTS: **

When you create your repositories for your homework, use a new readme.md and not the readme file located in the homework folders.  The graders have the instructions for the homework already.  Provide a readme.md file with instructions for the graders on which files are your final or any special instructions.  

Topics to consider adding to your readme:
1. Title of the homework
2. Date Due or Date Completed
3. Files the user should open or review first
4. Any instructions on use? 
5. List languages / libraries or other tools used that help you stand out!
6. If a shared project, list all the users / contributors to the repository, maybe include links to their GitHub accounts. 
7. If you found a new library / piece of code or project that inspired your learning, cite in the readme what you used and include a link. 

Most of all - Have some fun!  Learn how to use the readme as a COMMUNICATION tool.  It's a part of the story you are sharing to showcase your work.
